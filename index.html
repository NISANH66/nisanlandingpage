                <p>Nisan, a native Israeli Jew, grew up in Bat Yam city. He recently completed 12 years of
                    schooling,
                    earning a high school diploma with a strong performance in film class. After graduation, Nisan spent
                    two years and eight months fulfilling his mandatory military service. He thoroughly enjoyed his time
                    there.

                    Currently, Nisan works as a security guard for a government company. While employed full-time, he is
                    actively pursuing a career in front-end development. He's a self-taught developer, demonstrating
                    exceptional talent without the need for formal courses.

                    Nisan is now actively seeking a job in front-end development, eager to leverage his skills and
                    passion for the field.</p>
